# Intro to multiplication

Multiplication is like a shortcut for repeated addition. Instead of adding 2+2+2, you can multiply 2x3 and get the same answer! Whether you're using a number line, drawing groups of objects, or just crunching the numbers in your head.

## Multiplication as equal groups

Let's dive into the concept of multiplication using the example of a squirrel collecting acorns.

Every day the squirrel collects exactly 3 acorns. How many acorns will he have after doing this for 5 days?

We can see it as equal groups. There is `5 groups` of `3 acorns`.

It can be expressed as:
- 5 times 3
- `3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3` = `6 + 3 + 3 + 3` = `9 + 3 + 3` = `12 + 3` = `15`
- `5 x 3` = `15`
- 5 groups of 3 or 3 groups of 5

## Multiplication as repeated addition

`2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2` = `12`
`6 x 2` = `12`
`2 x 6` = `12`

## Multiplication on the number line

We can see multiplication as groups:
